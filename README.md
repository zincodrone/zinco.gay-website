This is my first attempt to create my own website. Let's see how this goes.


# **To-Do List**

## TBD
### - Blog ❓
####     For thought pieces, introspection, and other things that are best written out.
### - Biography 🟨
####     Telling new visitors to my website who I am, what I do, and how to contact me.
### - Cool looking layout ❓    
####     Layout is unlikely to be in anyway cool looking as this is just a website to replace my linktree as of right now. I need inspiration anyway to design something cool looking.
### - Activity Log ❓
####         Place to log activities in my daily life, what I've been up to, and maybe linking to my blog(who knows?).
