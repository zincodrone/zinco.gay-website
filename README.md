This is my first attempt to create my own website. Let's see how this goes.


To-Do List

TBD
    Blog ❓
        For thought pieces, introspection, and other things that are best written out.
    Biography ❓
        Telling new visitors to my website who I am, what I do, and how to contact me.
    Cool looking layout ❓    
        Layout is unlikely to be in anyway cool looking as this is just a website to replace my linktree as of right now. I need inspiration anyway to design something cool looking.
    Activity Log ❓
        Place to log activities in my daily life, what I've been up to, and maybe linking to my blog(who knows?).
